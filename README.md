# Plugin Domoscio for Moodle

This plugin integrate the Domoscio algorithm to consolidate knowledge into Moodle.

The solution comes with the Domoscio plugin contained into "domoscio" folder to be placed into the "mod" folder, and a Domoscio Reminder, useful for students, to be placed into "blocks" folder

[Get the Domoscio Reminder block](https://github.com/Celumproject/moodle-block_domoscioreminder)

This branch contains the plugin for Moodle 2.9

CHANGELOG :
- As Moodle 2.9 already include jQuery library, this plugin version is not embedding jQuery anymore.
